      details: |
        Part of academic team investigating the use of Cortical's 'Semantic Folding'
        in predicting stock and commodity price volatility using close to one billion
        news articles going back to 2016. Responsibilities include:

          - Building and maintaining infrastructure using Python, PostGreSQL, Docker and
            Google Cloud Services to process historical and current news articles using
            Cortical's semantic folding algorithm.
          - Aid in collecting and preprocessing training data to create custom models.
          - Design and implement downstream tests to assess the usefulness of custom
            models, including the implementation of several monte carlo experiments.
          - Provide support to other researchers in terms of statistical expertise and
            by creating custom docker applications that simplify the access to the
            custom models by means of a local API.

    - role: Data Scientist

        Data analyst at the Leiden Center for Innovation, Online Learning Lab (OLL).
        The OLL facilitates the development of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
        at Leiden University. I was responsible for retrieving, storing and analysing
        MOOC data with the aim of improving courses and providing feedback to content
        creators & academics. Co-published several academic articles with researchers
        and published open-source tools for analysing MOOC data."

        and advice. While at the HCSS, I worked on several projects in areas of Big Data,
        security studies, and international development. Further set up an event-monitoring
        server that scraped and processed roughly 20.000-50.000 news articles each day, and
        created a package in R to analyze assertive behaviour among 'great powers' such as
        Russia, the United States and China.
