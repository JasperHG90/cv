    - role: Data Scientist
      time: January 2020 - present
      company: FinTxt, The Hague
      details: |
        Data scientist in a team of finance researchers at the Toulouse Business School and Ben Gurion university. In this role,
        I primarily manage and analyze large textual datasets, and also develop methodological tools that the researchers can use 
        to process and analyze their own data.

    - role: Data Scientist
      time: Oct 2018 - December 2019
      company: Leiden University Center for Innovation, The Hague
      details: |
        The CFI data intelligence guild supports Leiden University and its partners to make positive social impact using data 
        and artificial intelligence. We do so by piloting data-driven solutions to societal challenges, while taking into account 
        the human aspects of data such as privacy, transparency and fairness. I was part of the Data Intelligence Team, a small group of
        data scientists that provide analytics for our partners. 

    - role: Research intern
      time: Jun 2018 - Aug 2018 and Jun 2019 - Aug 2019
      company: Cortical.io, Vienna
      details: |
        Part of an academic team investigating the use of Cortical's Semantic Folding algorithm
        to predict stock and commodity price volatility using close to one billion
        news articles going back to 2016. Responsibilities include:

          - Gaining an in-depth understanding of Cortical.io's core
            technology and its application to large, textual datasets.
          - Develop methods to process, store and query news articles
            using Cortical.io's semantic folding technology.
          - Use these methods to develop a prototype for visualizing and
            downloading historical and live data representing the nature
            and quantity of news relevant to user-selected stocks, commodities
            and portfolios.
          - Serving as liaision between the research team led by Prof. David
            Stolin and Cortical.
          - Building and maintaining infrastructure using Python, PostGreSQL, Docker and
            Google Cloud Services to process historical and current news articles using
            Cortical's semantic folding algorithm.
          - Aid in collecting and preprocessing training data to create custom models using Cortical's semantic folding algorithm.
          - Design and implement downstream tests to assess the usefulness of custom
            models, using e.g. monte carlo simulations, clustering methods and convolutional/recurrent neural networks.
          - Provide support to other researchers in terms of statistical expertise and
            by creating custom docker applications that simplify the access to the
            custom models.

    - role: Data Analyst
      time: Mar 2015 - Feb 2017
      company: Leiden University Center for Innovation, The Hague

        The Center for Innovation facilitates the development of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) at Leiden University. 
        I was responsible for retrieving, storing and analysing MOOC data with the aim of improving courses and providing 
        feedback to content creators and academics. Co-published several academic articles with researchers and published 
        open-source tools to process and analyze MOOC data.

    - role: Assistant Strategic Analyst (Internship Program)
      time: Sep 2014 - Feb 2015
      company: The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, The Hague
      details: |
        The HCSS helps governments, non-governmental organisations and the private
        sector to anticipate the challenges of the future with practical policy solutions
        and advice. While at the HCSS, I worked on several projects in areas of Big Data,
        security studies, and international development. Further set up an event-monitoring
        server that scraped and processed roughly 20.000-50.000 news articles each day, and
        created a package in R to analyze assertive behaviour among 'great powers' such as
        Russia, the United States and China.
