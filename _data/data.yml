        The OLL facilitates the development of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
        at Leiden University. I was responsible for retrieving, storing and analysing
        MOOC data with the aim of improving courses and providing feedback to content
        creators & academics. Co-published several academic articles with researchers
        and published open-source tools for analysing MOOC data."

        and advice. While at the HCSS, I worked on several projects in areas of Big Data,
        security studies, and international development. Further set up an event-monitoring
        server that scraped and processed roughly 20.000-50.000 news articles each day, and
        created a package in R to analyze assertive behaviour among 'great powers' such as
        Russia, the United States and China.
